                    Hello, <br />
                    i'm Darek, a student of University in Gdansk. I've created this app to represent myself,
                    i think this is one of the best ways to practice my skills.
                    Whats skills you ask? I think beeing a good programmer is not only to be a good programmer
                    technically. That concerns every type of human/worker. You need to find yourself.
                    Find yourself means finding your bad and proper sides and to know them. If you want to introduce yourself with
                    this topic i'm sending you
                    <a href="slideEdge.html" class="link">Here</a>
                    <br />

                    In this app
                    i will try to made my own notes and objectives:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        About projects that i'm actually doing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        About things that i've done for today even the smallest
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other everyday stuff like: physical training, do the washing etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text">
                    You will ask why ?
                    Beacuse all that kind of activities is a small victory. I want to see how many things i've done overtime to get my point of self-development.
